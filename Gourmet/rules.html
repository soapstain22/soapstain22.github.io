		  <ul>
			<li>RULE #1 - chill out</li>
			<li>RULE #2 - if you leave for attention, everyone will get sick of your shit! this also applies to threats of leaving the server, ddos attacks, killing me in real life</li>
			<li>RULE #3 - play fair. you can use x-ray to do whatever but understand that you aren’t slick. just x-ray for materials for yourself and yourself only, because it just cuts out like 6 hours of adventuring. </li>
			<li>RULE #4 - assume everything is fair game. if something isnt protected its considered public</li>
			<li>RULE #5 - don’t beat the shit out of random people. pretend these people know where you live and will call your mom and get her involved</li>
			<li>RULE #6 - i will not give you admin</li>
			<li>RULE #7 - NOBODY WANTS TO PLAY ON YOUR SERVER!!!!!!!!!! i work very hard to keep this server nice so please don't advertise your other minecraft server or ill kick your ass</li>
			<li>RULE #8 - your account is your account. if you think you are slick by saying "my brother was on my account and griefed the map" idgaf! dont let this happen in the first place then</li>
